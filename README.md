## Purpose

Just learning a bit about supabase and how it works. Super cool project. I like the idea of exposing a firebase type API, but the underlying technology being opensource, well established tech.

I had deployed this using vercel, but have since taken the project down. I created a simple app that manages virtual classrooms and allows teachers to add students to a roster and create helpful links. Students can also create journal entries for teachers to review and leave comments for.

Created using Sveltekit, Supabase, Tailwind, TipTap, and SkeletonUI.
